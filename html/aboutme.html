              <h2>Hello dear reader, I'm Carlos Arturo Núñez Franco and I'm 
                fascinated with what society can achieve with technology.</h2>
              <p>I'm a Salesforce platform developer at Ksquare University.
              Honors Graduate by completing the thesis "A Grasp-Tabu Heuristic 
              for the handover minimization problem" and obtaining Magna Cum Laude 
              in both industrial engineering and Mechatronics engineering at UDLAP. </p>
              <p>Ever since I was little, I was passionate about understanding how things work.
                I would take apart my toys to find out and ask a lot of questions that sometimes
                my parents couldn't answer. It was then when they realized the potential I had, so
                I joined multiple courses to keep learning new things, specially related to math
                 and robotics.
              </p>
              <p>Nowadays I like spending time in nature, some of my hobbies involve camping, gardening,
                 cooking, spending time outdoors and listing to music.
              </p>
              <p>My profesional goals focus on generate continuous growth, towards measurable objectives 
                and challenges, both in the personal and professional fields. Learn and develop new 
                knowledge and skills to contribute to the company and thus generate good performance 
                in any activities where I collaborate.
