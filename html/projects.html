            <h3>Thesis: A Grasp-Tabu Heuristic for the Handover Minimization Problem</h3>
            <P>May 2020</P>
            <p>This thesis proposes a hybrid GRASP-Tabu heuristic that finds feasible solutions for the NP Hard Capacitaded Clustering Problem (CCP).
            The problem fucus on minimazing the handover in telecomunications grids.</p>

            <p>May 2019</p>
            <p>Final joint project for electrical machines and power electronics subjects in which we designed and built both the 
              mechanical and electrical parts of an electric scooter with velocity control using a boost converter and a 500W dc Motor.</p>

            <h3>Line Follower with PID</h3>
            <p>Nov 2018</p>
            <p>Final Control System's Project. We designed a line follower with 8 sensons and PID controll for competions.
              PID (proportional integral derivative) controllers use a control loop feedback mechanism to control process 
              variables and are the most accurate and stable controller.</p>

            <h3>XXIX International Industrial and Logistics Engineering Congress</h3>
            <p>Apr 2018</p>
            <p>Required activity for the student council. Being the event's coordinator in the Directive Board of Indistrial Engineering, I was in charge of the panning and
              logistics involved in the XXIX International Industrial and Logistics Engineering Congress hosted at UDLAP. We had 3 days of lectures and workshops about different
              relevant topics and 5 trips to plants such as Bimbo, Yakult, Schaeffler, BBVA and Stanley.

            <h3>Robotic Vacuum Cleaner</h3>
            <p>Nov 2017</p>
            <p>Final instrumentation and signal processing project. We designed a self-steered robotic vacuum cleaner that with the input of 3 ultrasolic sensors was aware of objects 
              and walls, thus changing its direction when needed.
