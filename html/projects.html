            <P>May 2020</P>
            <p>This thesis proposes a hybrid GRASP-Tabu heuristic that finds feasible solutions for the NP-Hard Capacitated Clustering Problem (CCP).
            The problem focuses on minimizing the handover in telecommunications grids.</p>

            <p>Nov 2018</p>
            <p>Final Control System's Project. We designed a line follower with 8 sensors and PID control for competitions.
              PID (proportional integral derivative) controllers use a control loop feedback mechanism to control process 
              variables and are the most accurate and stable controller.</p>

            <p>Apr 2018</p>
            <p>Required activity for the student council. Being the event's coordinator in the Directive Board of Industrial Engineering, I was in charge of the planning and
              logistics involved in the XXIX International Industrial and Logistics Engineering Congress hosted at UDLAP. We had 3 days of lectures and workshops about different
              relevant topics and 5 trips to plants such as Bimbo, Yakult, Schaeffler, BBVA, and Stanley.

            <p>Nov 2017</p>
            <p>Final instrumentation and signal processing project. We designed a self-steered robotic vacuum cleaner that with the input of 3 ultrasonic sensors was aware of objects 
              and walls, thus changing its direction when needed.

            <p>Nov 2015</p>
            <p>Assisted on the Master's Degree thesis 'Natural interfaces for navigation based on head movement recognition'. The thesis presents 'Head Gesture Control', a natural 
              interface alternative to traditional control peripherals to navigate virtual spaces by detecting movements that the user makes with their head. Among my tasks was designing 
              the user experience test and data analysis, as well as movement calibration and head recognition using the Viola-Jones algorithm.

            <p>Apr 2014</p>
            <p>In this research project conducted for an extra course in high school, we analyzed the percentage of people who self-medicate in Puebla and we explored 
              the consequences that this behavior can bring.

            <h3>Social Network Impact on Grades</h3>
            <p>Apr 2014</p>
            <p>Graduation project conducted during my last high school year. We gathered grade information about students who spend more than average time on social networks 
              and a control group (people who use around average time on social networks). Then we analyzed the results to see if there was a correlation between grades and time 
              spent on social networks.
